# üìö **Book Store Project**

## üìù Description 
The "Online Book Store" web application is developed using Spring Boot to create RESTful APIs that facilitate 
interaction between users (USER) and administrators (ADMIN) with the bookstore's database. 
The project demonstrates the application of modern authentication technologies and data management, 
simulating the core functionalities of e-commerce
in the book industry.

## Project Overview
The Book Store API offers the following functionalities:
* Roles: Defines two user roles: ADMIN and USER.
* ADMIN Book Management: Includes adding, removing, editing book information, and categorizing books.
* USER Shopping Cart: Allows users to select multiple books with different quantities before ordering.
* ADMIN Order Management: Enables saving and status tracking of orders.
